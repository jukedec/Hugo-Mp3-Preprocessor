# JukeDec

Requirements: GoLang install - I think that's it.

We got 2 files.

A Golang prog that reads mp3 files, grabs the metadata, and spits it out into .md files.

A bash command that does some file setup, runs the Hugo istall commands, and copies in files.


# Parameter 1 is the source folder that mp3s are stored in, Parameter 2 is the temporary folder where site is initially set up. Paramter 3 is the output directory of finished site.
